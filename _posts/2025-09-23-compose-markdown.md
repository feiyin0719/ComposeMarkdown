# 🚀 Compose Markdown: Breathe New Life into Markdown in Jetpack Compose!

🏠 [Project Home](https://github.com/feiyin0719/ComposeMarkdown)

> In the world of mobile development, Markdown rendering has always been a headache. Traditional WebView is bulky and slow, while native implementation is complex and tedious. But now, everything is different! 🎉

## ✨ Why Choose Compose Compose Markdown?

Imagine you're developing a tech blog app that needs to display complex Markdown content. Traditional solutions force you to make difficult choices between performance and functionality, but **Compose Markdown** makes it effortless!

### 🎯 Three Core Advantages

#### 1. 🎨 **Ultimate Customization** - Your Style, Your Choice

##### 🎨**Comprehensive Style Control** - Create Unique Visual Experiences

```kotlin
val customStyle = TypographyStyle(
    strongEmphasis = SpanStyle(
        fontWeight = FontWeight.Bold,
        color = Color(0xFF2196F3)  // Blue bold text makes highlights more prominent
    ),
    code = TextStyle(
        fontFamily = FontFamily.Monospace,
        fontSize = 14.sp,
        color = Color(0xFF37474F),
        background = Color(0xFFF5F5F5)  // Elegant code block styling
    ),
    // More styles waiting for you to explore...
)
```

Unlike those "one-size-fits-all" solutions, Compose Markdown gives you **complete style control**. From font colors to spacing layouts, from link styles to code highlighting, every detail can be customized to your liking!

##### 🔧 **Custom Node Recognition and Rendering** - Unlimited Extensions

More powerfully, you can create **completely custom renderers** for any Markdown syntax elements:

```kotlin
// Custom alert box renderer
class AlertRenderer : IBlockRenderer<CustomAlertBlock> {
    @Composable
    override fun Invoke(node: CustomAlertBlock, modifier: Modifier) {
        Card(
            modifier = modifier.fillMaxWidth(),
            colors = CardDefaults.cardColors(
                containerColor = when(node.type) {
                    "warning" -> Color(0xFFFFF3CD)
                    "error" -> Color(0xFFF8D7DA)
                    else -> Color(0xFFD1ECF1)
                }
            )
        ) {
            Row(modifier = Modifier.padding(16.dp)) {
                Icon(
                    imageVector = when(node.type) {
                        "warning" -> Icons.Filled.Warning
                        "error" -> Icons.Filled.Error
                        else -> Icons.Filled.Info
                    },
                    contentDescription = null
                )
                Spacer(modifier = Modifier.width(8.dp))
                Text(text = node.content)
            }
        }
    }
}

// Register custom renderer
val config = MarkdownRenderConfig.Builder()
    .addBlockRenderer(
        CustomAlertBlock::class.java, 
        AlertRenderer()
    )
    .build()
```

This means you can:
- 🎯 **Recognize Custom Syntax**: Like `:::warning` alert blocks
- 🎨 **Create Exclusive UI**: Render with Material Design 3 components
- 🔌 **Seamless Integration**: Perfect coexistence with existing Markdown syntax
- 📱 **Native Experience**: Fully Compose-styled, not HTML rendering

#### 2. ⚡ **Excellent Performance** - Lightning-fast Rendering Speed

##### ⚡ **Asynchronous Parsing**: Using coroutines and thread pools to keep UI thread unblocked

Traditional Markdown renderers either cause stuttering with synchronous parsing or have complex logic with asynchronous processing. Compose Markdown cleverly provides **dual options**:

```kotlin
// Small document? Synchronous rendering, ready to use!
MarkdownView(
    content = shortMarkdown,
    markdownRenderConfig = config
)

// Large document? Asynchronous processing, perfect user experience!
MarkdownView(
    content = longMarkdown,
    markdownRenderConfig = config,
    parseDispatcher = MarkdownThreadPool.dispatcher,
    onLoading = { CircularProgressIndicator() }
)
```

This intelligent design lets you choose the most appropriate rendering strategy based on content size - small documents open instantly, large documents don't stutter!

##### 🚀 **LazyMarkdownView** - The Ultimate Weapon for Large Documents

For **massive Markdown files** (like dozens of MB of technical documentation), we provide a revolutionary chunked lazy loading solution:

```kotlin
LazyMarkdownView(
    file = File("huge_documentation.md"),  // 50MB technical documentation
    markdownRenderConfig = config,
    chunkLoaderConfig = ChunkLoaderConfig(
        initialLineCount = 1000,
        incrementalLineCount = 500,
        minNodesAhead = 100,
        minNodesBehind = 30,
        maxCachedNodes = 500,
        maxCachedSourceLines = 10_000,
        parserDispatcher = MarkdownThreadPool.dispatcher,
    ),
    nestedPrefetchItemCount = 5  // Precompose 5 Compose items
)
```

**The Magic of Chunked Loading**:
- 📊 **Smart Chunking**: Split large files into small chunks, parsed on demand
- 👀 **Viewport Optimization**: Only render content visible to users
- 🔮 **Predictive Loading**: Smart preloading based on scroll direction
- 💾 **Memory Friendly**: No more OOM worries, regardless of file size
- ⚡ **Smooth Scrolling**: Built-in prefetch strategy, scrolling smooth as silk

This design lets you easily handle **arbitrarily large** Markdown files, from KB-sized READMEs to hundreds of MB complete project documentation!

#### 3. 🏗️ **Modern Architecture** - 100% Jetpack Compose

Say goodbye to the pain of hybrid development! Compose Markdown is pure Compose implementation from start to finish:
- 🎭 **State Management**: Smart caching using `remember` and `mutableStateOf`
- 🔄 **Asynchronous Processing**: `LaunchedEffect` with coroutines, smooth as silk
- 🧩 **Modular Design**: Each component is an independent Composable, highly reusable

## 🛠️ Simple Getting Started, Immediate Experience

### Basic Usage - Done in 3 Lines of Code

```kotlin
@Composable
fun MyMarkdownScreen() {
    val markdownContent = """
        # Welcome to Compose Markdown! 🎉
        
        This is an **awesome** Markdown rendering library:
        
        - ✅ Supports standard syntax
        - 🎨 Fully customizable
        - ⚡ Excellent performance
        
        ```kotlin
        // Code highlighting is also beautiful!
        fun hello() = println("Hello Compose!")
        ```
        
        | Feature | Support |
        |---------|---------|
        | Tables  | ✅ Perfect |
        | Images  | ✅ Perfect |
        | Links   | ✅ Perfect |
    """
    
    MarkdownView(
        content = markdownContent,
        markdownRenderConfig = MarkdownRenderConfig.Builder().build()
    )
}
```

That's how simple it is! Three lines of code, and you have a fully functional Markdown renderer!

### Advanced Customization - Create Your Own Style

```kotlin
@Composable
fun CustomStyledMarkdown() {
    val config = MarkdownRenderConfig.Builder()
        .theme(
            TypographyStyle(
                // Custom paragraph spacing
                spaceHeight = 12.dp,
                // Cool divider lines
                breakLineColor = Color(0xFF6200EA),
            
            )
        )
        .build()
    
    MarkdownView(
        content = yourMarkdown,
        markdownRenderConfig = config,
        linkInteractionListener = { url ->
            // Custom link click handling
            openInBrowser(url)
        }
    )
}
```

### Lazy Loading Lists - Handle Massive Content

For lists containing large amounts of Markdown content, we also thoughtfully provide `LazyMarkdownView`:

```kotlin
 LazyMarkdownView(
                file = file,
                markdownRenderConfig = config,
                modifier = Modifier
                    .fillMaxSize()
                    .padding(16.dp)
            )
  ```
